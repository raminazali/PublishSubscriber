### PublishSubscriber

This the Test Project

I Use the Rabbitmq And MongoDb Database With Dotnet Core 3.1 

# 
In this project, the publish subscribing method is used, which is the connection between two microservices that when an API is called, it sends the request information to another microservice using Rabbitmq, and that microservice stores the information in the MongoDb database.


# The concepts used in these codes are:

> RabbitMq 
> 
> Nosql MongoDb
> 
> .Net Core 3.1
> 
> DDD (Domain Driven Development)
> 
> Repository Pattern Development
